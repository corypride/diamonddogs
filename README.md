Project Concept: Happy Roots

Purpose: An interactive, user-friendly platform dedicated to researching plants, providing detailed plant care information, and allowing users to save plants for gardening projects. We decided to build this website because the Perenual API has an extensive database of information and media that will allow us to provide a unique and informative experience for our users. Designing the website as a gardening tool will allow us to implement all base features as well as some unique features that will show off our technical knowledge and skills.


Core Features--

Authentication: each user will be able to create their own profile with an email and password to use our site.
Profile customization: users will be able to customize their profile name and upload a unique photo for their profile.
Enhanced Plant Listings: Each plant listing includes in-depth care information, description of each plant, photos, and a hardiness map. All informmation will be pulled from the Perenual API (perenual.com).
Search: Our users will be able to search our entire database of plants by common name. Search results will link to a more detailed plant page.
FAQ: Users will be able to search our database by keyword for commonly asked plant questions.
Full CRUD Functionality: Users will be able to create gardens and add/delete favorite plants from them.
Relational Database: Users favorite plants will be stored in MySQL database that will appear in their garden.
Custom 404 page: if our users navigate to an area of our site that doesn't exist, we will have a custom 404 page to display.
Google analytics: this will be built into our site to track how our users interact with our website.
Browse page: This page will allow our users to explore our database without having to know the plant name. Photos and short description of each plant will appear here.

Additional Aspects:
Technologies: Java/JS for backend, MySQL for database, React for frontend.
External APIs: Perenual API for plant data.
Development Approach: Agile methodology, with a focus on clean code and documentation.
